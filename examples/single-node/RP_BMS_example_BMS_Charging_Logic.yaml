  # This is additional charging logic executed at the BMS level.
  # This logic turns the BMS's charge switch OFF when the battery is fully charged.
  # This prevents the battery from being overcharged while the other batteries continue to charge.
  # This logic acts directly on the charging MOSFETs; please use it only if necessary and at your own risk.
  # The BMS charge switch will be turned ON again during ReBulk.
